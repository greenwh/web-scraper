The first 9 months of work You can return to work for at least 9 months and still get your full Disability payment. We call this a “trial work period.” In 2025, any month you earn over $1,160 before taxes will count towards this trial. The months don't need to be consecutive, just within a rolling 5-year period. There's no limit on how much you can earn during the 9 months. The next 3 years of work After your 9-month work trial, there's a 36-month period called an “extended period of eligibility” (EPE) where you can work and still get Disability. The EPE earnings limit in 2025 is $1,620 per month, or $2,700 if you get Disability due to blindness. If you exceed the earnings limit in any month, you won’t be eligible for a Disability payment for that month. After your EPE, if you keep earning over the limit, your benefit will typically end. Learn how to restart your benefits if you can’t continue to work. Your earnings limit can increase in certain circumstances During the 3-year extended period of eligibility, if you have work expenses due to your disability, you may be able to earn more than the monthly limit without affecting your benefits, up to the value of those costs. For example, if you have to spend $250 per month on specific transportation needs, you can earn an extra $250 each month. Also during that time, your earnings limit could increase if your job offers a subsidy. We define a subsidy as extra support due to your disability, like paid breaks or less work than your peers. We’ll talk to your employer to determine the value of your subsidy. For example, they might tell us they give you extra paid breaks every week, worth $100. This would be your subsidy and you could earn up to that amount more than the earnings limit without reducing your benefit. When you report your work activity , be sure to report these expenses and subsidies as well. Keep your Medicare coverage During the 9-month trial and the following 93 months You can typically keep Part A (hospital insurance) at no cost but can’t withdraw unless you pay a premium. If you have Part B (medical insurance), you can keep it by continuing to pay the premium. After that You can pay for both Parts A and B and keep your coverage as long as you still have a disability. Part A usually becomes free again after age 65.

Medical/Professional Relations SSA Home Disability Medical/Professional Relations Disability Evaluation Under Social Security Listing of Impairments - Child Listings (Part B) 100.00 Low Birth Weight and Failure to Thrive - Childhood Adult Listings (Part A) Childhood Listings (Part B) General Information Evidentiary Requirements Listing of Impairments (overview) Revisions to Rules Regarding the Evaluation of Medical Evidence Disability Evaluation Under Social Security 100.00 Low Birth Weight and Failure to Thrive\n - Childhood Section 100.01 Category of Impairments, Low Birth Weight and Failure to Thrive 100.04 Low birth weight in infants from birth to attainment of age 1 100.05 Failure to thrive in children from birth to attainment of age 3 100.00 Low  Birth Weight and Failure to Thrive A. What conditions do we evaluate under these listings? We evaluate low birth weight (LBW) in infants from birth to attainment of age 1 and failure to thrive (FTT) in infants and toddlers from birth to attainment of age 3. B. How do we evaluate disability based on LBW under  100.04? In 100.04A and 100.04B ,\n    we use an infant’s birth weight as documented by an original or certified copy of the infant’s birth certificate or by a medical record signed by a physician. Birth weight means the first weight  recorded after birth.\n    In 100.04B , gestational age is the infant’s age based on the date of conception as recorded in the medical record.\n    If the infant’s impairment meets the requirements for listing 100.04A or 100.04B , \n      we will follow the rules in § 416.990(b)(11) of this chapter. C. How do we evaluate disability under 100.05 ? 1. General. We establish FTT with or without a known cause when we have documentation of an infant’s or toddler’s growth failure and developmental delay from an acceptable medical source(s) \n        as defined in § 416.913(a) of this chapter.\n    We require documentation of growth measurements in 100.05A and developmental delay in 100.05B or 100.05C within the same consecutive 12-month period.\n    The dates of developmental testing and reports may be different from  the dates of the growth measurements. After the attainment of age 3, we evaluate growth failure under the affected body system(s). 2. Growth failure. Under 100.05A ,\n    we use the appropriate table(s) under 105.08B in the digestive system to determine whether a child’s growth is less than the third percentile.\n    The child does not need to have a digestive disorder for the purposes of 100.05 . a.  For children from birth to attainment of age 2, we use the weight-for-length table corresponding to the child’s gender (Table I or Table II). b.  For children age 2 to the attainment of age 3, we use the body mass index (BMI)-for-age table corresponding to the child’s gender (Table III or Table IV). c.  BMI is the ratio of a child’s weight to the square of his or her height.\n          We calculate BMI using the formulas in the digestive disorders body system ( 105.00 ). d. Growth measurements. The weight-for-length measurements for children from birth to attainment of age 2 and BMI-for-age measurements in children age 2 to attainment of age 3 that are required for this listing must be obtained  within a 12-month period and at least 60 days apart. If a child attains 2  during the evaluation period, additional measurements are not needed. Any  measurements taken before the child attains age 2 can be used to evaluate the  impairment under the appropriate listing for the child’s age. If the child  attains age 3 during the evaluation period, the measurements can be used to  evaluate the impairment in the affected body system. 3. Developmental Delay. a.  Under 100.05B and C , \n      we use reports from acceptable medical sources to  establish delay in a child’s development. b.  Under 100.05B , \n      we document the severity of developmental delay with results from a standardized developmental assessment, \n      which compares a child’s level of development to the level typically expected for his or her chronological age.  \n      If the child was born prematurely, we may use the corrected chronological age (CCA) for comparison. \n      (See § 416.924b(b) of this chapter.)\n    CCA is the chronological age adjusted by a period of gestational prematurity. CCA=  (chronological age) – (number of weeks premature).\n    Acceptable medical sources or early intervention specialists, physical or occupational therapists, and other sources may conduct standardized developmental assessments and developmental screenings.\n    The results of these tests and screening must be accompanied by a statement or records from an acceptable medical source who established the child has a developmental delay. c. Under 100.05C , \n      when there are no results from a standardized developmental assessment in the case record, \n      we need narrative developmental reports from the child’s medical sources in sufficient detail to assess the severity of his or her developmental delay. \n      A narrative developmental report is based on clinical observations, progress notes, and well-baby check-ups. To meet the requirements for 100.05C ,\n    the report must include: the child’s developmental history; examination findings (with abnormal findings noted on repeated examinations); \n      and an overall assessment of the child’s development (that is, more than one or two  isolated skills) by the medical source. \n      Some narrative developmental reports may include results from developmental screening tests, which can identify a child who is not developing or achieving skills within expected timeframes. \n      Although medical sources may refer to screening test results as supporting evidence in the narrative developmental report, \n      screening test results alone cannot establish a diagnosis or the severity of developmental delay. D. How do we evaluate disorders that do not meet one  of our listings? 1.  We may find infants disabled due to other disorders when their birth weights are greater than 1200 grams but less than 2000 grams and their \n      weight and gestational age do not meet listing 100.04 . The most common disorders of prematurity and LBW include retinopathy of prematurity (ROP),\n    chronic lung disease of infancy (CLD, previously known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or  BPD), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),\n    and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). Other disorders include poor nutrition and growth failure, hearing disorders, seizure disorders, cerebral palsy, and developmental disorders.\n    We evaluate these disorders under the affected body systems. 2.  We may evaluate infants and toddlers with growth failure that is associated  with a known medical disorder under the body system of that medical disorder,  for example, the respiratory or digestive body systems. 3. If an infant or toddler has a severe medical  determinable impairment(s) that does not meet the criteria of any listing, \n      we must also consider whether the child has an impairment(s) that medically equals a listing \n      (see § 416.926 of this chapter).\n    If the child’s impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, we will determine whether the child’s  impairment(s) functionally equals the listings\n    (see § 416.926a of this chapter)\n    considering the factors in § 416.924a of this chapter.\n    We use the rules in § 416.994a of this chapter when we decide whether a child continues to be disabled. 100.01 Category of Impairments, Low Birth Weight and Failure to Thrive 100.04 Low birth weight in infants from birth to attainment of age 1.

B. What do we consider when we evaluate cancer\n              under these listings? We consider factors including: 1. Origin of the cancer. 2. Extent of involvement. 3. Duration, frequency, and response to therapy. 4. Effects of any post-therapeutic residuals. C. How do we apply these listings? We apply the criteria\n          in a specific listing to a cancer originating from that specific\n          site. D. What evidence do we need? 1.  We need medical evidence that specifies the type, extent, and site of the primary,\n          recurrent, or metastatic lesion. In the rare situation in which the primary site\n          cannot be identified, we will use evidence documenting the site(s) of metastasis\n          to evaluate the impairment under 13.27 in part A. 2. For operative procedures,\n          including a biopsy or a needle aspiration, we generally need a\n          copy of both the: a. Operative note, and b. Pathology report. 3. When we cannot get these documents, we will accept the summary\n          of hospitalization(s) or other medical reports. This evidence should\n          include details of the findings at surgery and, whenever appropriate,\n          the pathological findings. 4.\n          In some situations we may also need evidence about recurrence,\n          persistence, or progression of the cancer, the response to\n          therapy, and any significant residuals. (See 113.00G .) E. When do we need longitudinal\n              evidence? 1. Cancer with distant metastases. Most cancer of childhood consist of a local lesion with metastases to regional lymph nodes and, less often, distant metastases. We generally do not need longitudinal evidence for cancer that has metastasized beyond the regional lymph nodes because  this cancer usually meets the requirements of a listing. Exceptions are for  cancer with distant metastases that we expect to respond to anticancer therapy. For these exceptions, we usually need a longitudinal record of 3 months after therapy starts to determine whether the therapy achieved its intended effect, and whether this effect is likely to persist. 2. Other cancers . When there are no distant metastases,\n          many of the listings require that we consider your response to\n          initial anticancer therapy; that is, the initial planned\n          treatment regimen. This therapy may consist of a single modality\n          or a combination of modalities; that is, multimodal therapy (see 113.00I3 ). 3. Types of treatment . Whenever the initial planned\n                  therapy is a single modality, enough time must pass to allow\n                  a determination about whether the therapy will achieve its intended\n                  effect. If the treatment fails, the failure will often happen\n                  within 6 months after treatment starts, and there will often\n                  be a change in the treatment regimen. Whenever the initial planned therapy is multimodal,\n                  we usually cannot make a determination about the effectiveness of the therapy until we can determine the effects of all the planned modalities.\n                  In some cases, we may need to defer adjudication until we can assess the effectiveness of therapy.\n                  However, we do not need to defer adjudication to determine whether the therapy will achieve its intended effect if we can make a fully favorable determination\n                  or decision based on the length and effects of therapy,\n                  or the residuals of the cancer or therapy (see 113.00G ). F. How do we evaluate\n              impairments that do not meet one of the cancer listings? 1. These listings are only examples of cancer that we consider severe enough to result in marked and\n          severe functional limitations. If your impairment(s) does not\n          meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider\n          whether you have an impairment(s) that meets the criteria of\n          a listing in another body system. 2. If you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing,\n          we will determine whether your impairment(s) medically equals a listing.\n          (See §§ 404.1526 and 416.926 of this chapter.)\n          If your impairment(s) does not meet or medically equal a listing, we will also consider whether you have an impairment(s) that functionally equals the listings.\n          (See § 416.926a of this chapter.)\n          We use the rules in §§ 416.994a of this chapter when we decide whether you continue to be disabled. G. How do we consider the effects of anticancer therapy? 1. How we consider the effects of therapy under the listings .\n          In many cases, cancers meet listing criteria only if the therapy is not effective and the cancer persists, progresses, or recurs. However, as explained in the following paragraphs, we will not delay adjudication if we can make a fully favorable determination or decision based on the evidence in the case record. 2. Effects can vary widely. a. We consider each case on an individual basis because the therapy and its toxicity may vary widely. We will request a specific description of the therapy, including these items: i. Drugs given. ii. Dosage. iii. Frequency of drug administration. iv. Plans for continued drug administration. v. Extent of surgery. vi. Schedule and fields of radiation therapy. b. We will also request a description of the complications or adverse effects of\n          therapy, such as the following: i. Continuing gastrointestinal symptoms. ii. Persistent weakness. iii. Neurological complications. iv. Cardiovascular complications. v. Reactive mental disorders. 3. Effects of therapy may change . The severity of the adverse effects of anticancer therapy may change during treatment; therefore, enough time must pass to allow us to evaluate the therapy's effect. The residual effects of treatment are temporary in most instances; however, on occasion, the effects may be disabling for a consecutive period of at least 12 months. In some situations, very serious adverse effects may interrupt and prolong multimodal anticancer therapy for a continuous period of almost 12 months. In these situations, we may determine there is an expectation that you",

Which musculoskeletal disorders do we evaluate under these listings? 1. We evaluate disorders of the skeletal spine (vertebral column) or of the upper or lower extremities that affect musculoskeletal \n                            functioning under these listings. We use the term “skeletal” when we are referring to the structure of the bony skeleton. \n                            The skeletal spine refers to the bony structures, ligaments, and discs making up the spine. \n                            We refer to the skeletal spine in some musculoskeletal listings to differentiate it from the neurological spine (see 101.00B1 ).\n                            Musculoskeletal disorders may be congenital or acquired, and may include deformities, amputations, or other abnormalities.\n                            These disorders may involve the bones or major joints; or the tendons, ligaments, muscles, or other soft tissues. 2. We evaluate soft tissue injuries (including burns) or abnormalities that are under continuing surgical management \n                            (see 101.00P1 ). \n                            The injuries or abnormalities may affect any part of the body, including the face and skull. 3. We evaluate curvatures of the skeletal spine that affect musculoskeletal functioning under 101.15 .\n                            If a curvature of the skeletal spine is under continuing surgical management (see 101.00P1 ),\n                            we will evaluate it under 101.21 using our rules for determining medical equivalence.\n                            See § 416.926 of this chapter. B. Which related disorders do we evaluate under other listings? 1. We evaluate a disorder or injury of the skeletal spine that results in damage to, and neurological dysfunction of, \n                            the spinal cord and its associated nerves (for example, paraplegia or quadriplegia) under the listings in 111.00 . 2. We evaluate inflammatory arthritis (for example, rheumatoid arthritis) under the listings in 114.00 . 3. We evaluate curvatures of the skeletal spine that interfere with your ability to breathe under the listings in 103.00 , impair myocardial function under the listings in 104.00 , or result in social withdrawal or depression under the listings in 112.00 . 4. We evaluate non-healing or pathological fractures due to cancer, whether it is a primary site or metastases, under the listings in 113.00 . 5. We evaluate the leg pain associated with peripheral vascular claudication under the listings in 104.00 . 6. We evaluate burns that do not require continuing surgical management under the listings in 108.00 . Back to Top C. What evidence do we need to evaluate your musculoskeletal disorder? 1. General. We need objective medical evidence from an acceptable medical source to establish that you have a\n                            medically determinable musculoskeletal disorder.\n                            We also need evidence from both medical and nonmedical sources,\n                            who can describe how you function, to assess the severity and duration of your musculoskeletal disorder.\n                            We will determine the extent and kinds of evidence we need from medical and nonmedical sources based on the individual facts about your disorder.\n                            For our basic rules on evidence, see §§ 416.912 , 416.913 , and 416.920b of this chapter.\n                            For our rules on evidence about your symptoms,\n                            see § 416.929 of this chapter. 2. Physical examination report(s). In the report(s) of your physical examination, \n                            we require a medical source's detailed description of the orthopedic, neurologic, \n                            or other objective clinical findings appropriate to your specific musculoskeletal disorder from his or her direct observations during your physical examination. \n                            We will not accept a report of your statements about your symptoms and limitations in place of the medical source’s report of objective clinical findings. \n                            We will not use findings on imaging or other diagnostic tests (see 101.00C3 ) as a substitute for findings on physical examination. a. When the medical source reports that a clinical test sign(s) is positive, unless we have evidence to the contrary, we will assume that he or she performed the test properly and accept the medical source’s interpretation of the test. For example, we will assume a straight-leg raising test was conducted properly (that is, in sitting and supine positions), even if the medical source does not specify the positions in which the test was performed. b. If you use an assistive device (see 101.00C6 ), \n                            the report must support the medical need for the device. c. If your musculoskeletal disorder causes a reduction in muscle strength, the report must document measurement of the strength of the muscle(s) in question. The measurement should be based on a muscle strength grading system that is considered medically acceptable based on your age and impairments. For example, a grading system of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating complete loss of strength and 5 indicating maximum strength or equivalent medically acceptable scale (see Table 1). Reduction in muscle strength is demonstrated by evidence that your muscle strength is less than active range of motion (ROM) against gravity with maximum resistance. If the reduction in muscle strength involves one or both of your hands, the report must also document measurements of grip and pinch strength. Table 1 - Grading System of Muscle Function Grade Function of the Muscle 0 None No visible or palpable contraction. 1 Trace Visible or palpable contraction with no motion. 2 Poor Active ROM with gravity eliminated. 3 Fair Active ROM against gravity only, without resistance. 4 Good Active ROM against gravity, moderate resistance. 5 Normal Active ROM against gravity, maximum resistance. 3. Imaging and other diagnostic tests. a. Imaging refers to medical imaging techniques, such as x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and radionuclide scanning. For the purpose of these listings, the imaging must be consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice as the proper technique to s",
